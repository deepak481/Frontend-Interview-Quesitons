## Upgrading from React v16 to React v17: Key Changes and Notes

### 1. Gradual Upgrades

**Concept:**
- In React v16, you had to upgrade the entire app at once.
- React v17 allows gradual upgrades, meaning you can update parts of your app incrementally.

**How It Works:**
- **Folder Structure:**
  - `src`: Root of the source tree, non-React dependent code.
  - `src/legacy`: Code using the older React version.
  - `src/modern`: Code using the updated React version.
  - `src/shared`: Components reused by both legacy and modern code.
  
  - Changes in `src/shared` are copied to both `src/legacy/shared` and `src/modern/shared`.

- **Basic Setup:**
  - Use three `package.json` files:
    - **Root `package.json`**: React-agnostic code.
    - **`src/legacy/package.json`**: React dependencies for legacy code.
    - **`src/modern/package.json`**: React dependencies for modern code.
  
  - `npm install` in the root runs `npm install` in both `src/legacy` and `src/modern` folders.

### 2. Event Delegation

**Concept:**
- In React < v17, event handlers are attached to the document node.
- In React v17, event handlers are attached to the root DOM container.

**Benefit:**
- This prevents issues when multiple React versions register handlers at the document level.
- Requires both React versions on the page to be v17 or higher.

### 3. New JSX Transform

**Concept:**
- In React v16, JSX is compiled to `React.createElement`, requiring React to be in scope.
- In React v17, a new transform allows JSX to compile without manually importing React.

**Benefit:**
- Reduces bundle size slightly by eliminating the need to import React for JSX.

### 4. Effect Cleanup Timing

**Concept:**
- In React v16, the cleanup function in `useEffect` runs synchronously during unmounting.
- In React v17, the cleanup function runs asynchronously.

**Benefit:**
- Improves performance by updating the screen before running the cleanup.

### 5. No Event Pooling

**Concept:**
- React v16 used event pooling, requiring `e.persist()` to keep event data.
- React v17 removes event pooling.

**Benefit:**
- Simplifies event handling; event fields are accessible whenever needed.

### 6. Consistent Errors for Returning Undefined

**Concept:**
- In React v16, returning undefined throws an error only for class and functional components, not for `forwardRef` and `memo`.
- In React v17, this error is consistent across all components.

**Example:**
```jsx
let Button = forwardRef(() => {
  // This will throw an error in React 17
  <button />;
});

let Button = memo(() => {
  // This will throw an error in React 17
  <button />;
});
```

### Conclusion

React v17 brings enhancements and lays a solid foundation for future breaking changes. Upgrading to this version ensures compatibility with upcoming features and improvements.

**Additional Changes Not Discussed:**
1. Aligning with Browsers (changes in `onScroll`, `onFocus`, `onBlur`, and `onClickCapture` events).
2. Native Component Stacks (provides better stack traces for debugging).
3. Removing Private Exports (React Native for Web no longer needs them).

### Notes

- **Gradual Upgrades**: Useful for large, legacy codebases.
- **Event Delegation**: Prevents conflicts with multiple React versions.
- **New JSX Transform**: Simplifies code and reduces bundle size.
- **Effect Cleanup Timing**: Enhances performance for heavy apps.
- **No Event Pooling**: Simplifies event handling.
- **Consistent Errors**: Ensures error handling consistency across all components.
