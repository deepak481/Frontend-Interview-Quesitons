# Interviewer: How do you review ReactJS code?

**You:** When reviewing ReactJS code, I follow a structured approach to ensure the code is robust, maintainable, and adheres to best practices. Here’s a breakdown of my process:

1. **Components**:
   - **Thinking in React**: I first check if the developer is following the "Thinking in React" methodology by breaking the code into smaller, reusable components. For instance, instead of having a single large `Homepage.jsx` component, it should be divided into logical subcomponents like `Header`, `MainContent`, and `Footer`. This helps in enhancing reusability and maintainability.
   - **Separation of Concerns**: I ensure that business logic is not all in one component but appropriately separated.

2. **Props & Props-Drilling**:
   - **Use of Props**: I look for proper usage of props for passing data and values instead of hardcoding them. Props provide flexibility and control over the content.
   - **Avoiding Props-Drilling**: I check if deep props-drilling is avoided, as it can lead to performance issues due to excessive re-renders.

3. **States**:
   - **State Management**: States should be managed using React’s state management system, not plain JavaScript. I make sure the distinction between UI state and application state is clear. UI states should be handled at the component level, while application states should be lifted to the parent level.
   - **Example**: Here’s an example to illustrate this distinction:

   ```jsx
   // Application State: Lifted to the parent component
   function App() {
     const [user, setUser] = useState(null); // Application state for user data

     const handleLogin = (userData) => {
       setUser(userData);
     };

     return (
       <div>
         <Header user={user} />
         <MainContent onLogin={handleLogin} />
         <Footer />
       </div>
     );
   }

   // UI State: Handled at the component level
   function MainContent({ onLogin }) {
     const [username, setUsername] = useState(''); // UI state for form input
     const [password, setPassword] = useState(''); // UI state for form input

     const handleSubmit = () => {
       const userData = { username, password }; // Example data
       onLogin(userData);
     };

     return (
       <div>
         <input
           type="text"
           value={username}
           onChange={(e) => setUsername(e.target.value)}
           placeholder="Username"
         />
         <input
           type="password"
           value={password}
           onChange={(e) => setPassword(e.target.value)}
           placeholder="Password"
         />
         <button onClick={handleSubmit}>Login</button>
       </div>
     );
   }

   function Header({ user }) {
     return (
       <header>
         <h1>Welcome, {user ? user.username : 'Guest'}</h1>
       </header>
     );
   }

   function Footer() {
     return <footer>Footer Content</footer>;
   }
   ```

4. **Consistency in Styling Method**:
   - **Styling Approach**: I ensure that there is consistency in the styling method used throughout the project, whether it's CSS, SASS, Styled Components, or CSS Modules. Consistency is key to maintainability.

5. **Consistency in File Extension**:
   - **File Extensions**: React supports both `.js` and `.jsx` extensions. I ensure that the project uses one consistently to maintain a clean architecture.

6. **Semantic HTML**:
   - **Semantic JSX**: I verify that JSX is written semantically, mirroring semantic HTML. For example, using `<header>` for header components instead of generic `<div>` tags.

7. **Context API before Redux**:
   - **State Management Tools**: I assess the scale of the project to determine if the Context API is sufficient or if a state management library like Redux or MobX is necessary. For smaller projects, the Context API is often more appropriate.

8. **Functional Code**:
   - **Functional Components**: I encourage writing functional components and extracting methods and functions outside of the components to enhance reusability and maintain a clean codebase.

9. **Props Validation**:
   - **Validation**: I ensure props validation is in place using PropTypes, Flow, or TypeScript. This helps catch errors early and define prop types and default values.

10. **Clean Folder Structure**:
   - **Organization**: I look for a clean folder structure, ensuring unnecessary files and folders from the bootstrapping process (like Create React App) are removed. Following popular conventions helps maintain a clean project architecture.

11. **Testing**:
   - **Testing Practices**: I ensure the codebase includes testing practices, starting with snapshot testing and progressing to unit and E2E testing. Tools like Jest, Enzyme, and React Testing Library are commonly used.

12. **Avoid Over Engineering**:
   - **Simplicity**: Aim for simple, readable, and maintainable code solutions. Over-engineering should be avoided, and code should be collaborative and understandable by others.

13. **Hooks before Lifecycle**:
   - **Using Hooks**: Prefer using hooks for managing state and side effects over class lifecycle methods. Hooks often improve performance and keep components functional.

By following this structured approach, I ensure that the ReactJS code is of high quality, maintainable, and adheres to best practices.
