### Why It's Never a Good Idea to Store Derived State in React

**Derived State Overview**
Derived state in React refers to any state that can be computed from existing state values. For example, if you have three counters in your app, each with its own state, the sum of those counters is a derived state. Storing this derived state separately can lead to inconsistencies and errors, as the derived state can fall out of sync with the actual state.

**Identifying Derived State**
Consider a React component managing a list of users. Each user has a name and an ID, stored in the component's state. Now, suppose you need to track a selected user:

```javascript
const [users, setUsers] = useState([
  { id: 1, name: 'Kyle' },
  { id: 2, name: 'Sara' },
]);

const [selectedUser, setSelectedUser] = useState(users[0]);
```

This code is problematic because `selectedUser` is derived from the `users` array. If the `users` array changes (e.g., updating a user's name), the `selectedUser` may become out of sync.

**Example of the Issue**
After updating the user in the `users` array, the selected user remains outdated:

```javascript
setUsers([
  { id: 1, name: 'Kate' },  // Updated name
  { id: 2, name: 'Sara' },
]);

// `selectedUser` still holds the previous name 'Kyle'
```

**Fixing the Issue**
Instead of storing the entire `selectedUser`, store the selected user's ID and derive the `selectedUser` from the `users` array:

```javascript
const [selectedUserId, setSelectedUserId] = useState(1);
const selectedUser = users.find(user => user.id === selectedUserId);
```

Now, if the `users` array is updated, the `selectedUser` will always be in sync because it's derived from the current state of `users`.

**Using `useMemo` for Expensive Computations**
In some cases, recalculating derived state might be CPU-intensive. Reactâ€™s `useMemo` hook can optimize performance by memoizing the derived value, recalculating it only when dependencies change:

```javascript
const selectedUser = useMemo(() => {
  return users.find(user => user.id === selectedUserId);
}, [users, selectedUserId]);
```

However, use `useMemo` only when the calculation is expensive. For lightweight computations like finding a user in an array, `useMemo` may introduce unnecessary overhead.

**Conclusion**
Avoid storing derived state to prevent inconsistencies and bugs. Instead, derive such state from the existing state dynamically. Use `useMemo` only for performance optimization when dealing with computationally expensive derived states.

### Full Code Example

Here's how the example should be structured in code:

```javascript
import React, { useState, useMemo } from 'react';

function UserComponent() {
  const [users, setUsers] = useState([
    { id: 1, name: 'Kyle' },
    { id: 2, name: 'Sara' },
  ]);

  const [selectedUserId, setSelectedUserId] = useState(1);

  // Without useMemo (simpler and efficient for small arrays)
  const selectedUser = users.find(user => user.id === selectedUserId);

  // With useMemo (useful for expensive computations)
  const memoizedSelectedUser = useMemo(() => {
    return users.find(user => user.id === selectedUserId);
  }, [users, selectedUserId]);

  const updateUser = () => {
    setUsers(prevUsers =>
      prevUsers.map(user =>
        user.id === 1 ? { ...user, name: 'Kate' } : user
      )
    );
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Selected User: {selectedUser.name}</h1>
      <button onClick={() => setSelectedUserId(2)}>Select Sara</button>
      <button onClick={updateUser}>Update Kyle to Kate</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default UserComponent;
```

This approach ensures that the `selectedUser` remains in sync with the actual state, avoiding potential issues with derived state.
