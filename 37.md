# Performance Optimization (Profiler, memo, callback, Code Splitting, Lazy Loading, Tree Shaking, API Call performance).

## Profiler in React

The `<Profiler>` is a React component that allows you to measure the rendering performance of a React tree programmatically.

### Basic Usage

```jsx
<Profiler id="App" onRender={onRender}>
  <App />
</Profiler>
```

- **Wrap a component tree in a `<Profiler>` to measure its rendering performance.**

  - **id**: To identify which Profiler it is.
  - **onRender**: Callback function that React calls every time components within the profiled tree update.

### onRender Callback
The `onRender` callback receives information about what was rendered and how much time it took. 

#### onRender Parameters
```javascript
function onRender(id, phase, actualDuration, baseDuration, startTime, commitTime) {
  // Callback implementation
}
```

- **id**: The id of the Profiler that just committed. This helps identify which part of the tree was committed if multiple profilers are being used.
- **phase**: "mount", "update", or "nested-update", indicating whether the tree was mounted for the first time or re-rendered due to changes in props, state, or Hooks.
- **actualDuration**: (in milliseconds) The time spent rendering the `<Profiler>` and its subtree during the current update. It shows how effective memoization (using `memo` and `useMemo`) is. Ideally, this should decrease after the initial mount as only components with changed props re-render.
- **baseDuration**: (in milliseconds) The estimated time to render the entire subtree without any optimizations. This is calculated by summing the most recent render durations of each component, representing the worst-case rendering time (e.g., initial mount or no memoization). Comparing this to `actualDuration` helps assess the effectiveness of memoization.
- **startTime**: (numeric timestamp) When React started rendering the current update.
- **commitTime**: (numeric timestamp) When React finished committing the update. This is shared between all profilers in a commit, enabling them to group and correlate the data they provide.

By default, Profiler is disabled in the production build. To enable it:
```bash
npm run build -- --profile
```

### Example Usage
#### Single Profiler
```jsx
<Profiler id="App" onRender={onRender}>
  <App />
</Profiler>
```

#### Multiple Profilers
```jsx
<App>
  <Profiler id="Sidebar" onRender={onRender}>
    <Sidebar />
  </Profiler>
  <Profiler id="Content" onRender={onRender}>
    <Content>
      <Profiler id="Editor" onRender={onRender}>
        <Editor />
      </Profiler>
      <Preview />
    </Content>
  </Profiler>
</App>
```

### Performance Considerations
Although `<Profiler>` is a lightweight component, it should be used only when necessary. Each use adds some CPU and memory overhead to an application.

### Interactive Profiler
For an interactive profiling experience, use the Profiler tab in React Developer Tools.

Let's break down the file content in-depth, focusing on code splitting in React with Vite, including practical examples and explanations.

## Code Splitting in React with Vite

### Introduction
Code splitting is a performance optimization technique used to improve the initial load time of a large application by dividing the code into smaller bundles. This helps in maintaining a performance budget, for example, keeping the initial page load under 100kb.

### Static vs. Dynamic Imports
In ECMAScript modules (ESM), there are two ways to import files:
1. **Static import**: Directly importing modules, which increases the final bundle size.
2. **Dynamic async import**: Using `import()` to asynchronously load modules only when needed, reducing the initial bundle size.

### Example of Code Splitting with React and Vite
The following example demonstrates how to use dynamic imports with React's `lazy` and `Suspense` components to implement code splitting.

#### Static Import
```javascript
import { useState, lazy, Suspense } from "react";
import { Banner } from "./components/Banner";
```

#### Dynamic Imports
```javascript
const Home = lazy(() =>
    import("./components/Home").then((module) => ({ default: module.Home }))
);
const About = lazy(() => import("./components/About"));
```

#### App Component
```javascript
export default function App() {
    const [tab, setTab] = useState<"home" | "about">("home");

    return (
        <main>
            <Banner />

            <nav>
                <button onClick={() => setTab("home")}>Home</button>
                <button onClick={() => setTab("about")}>About</button>
            </nav>

            {tab === "home" ? (
                <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
                    <Home />
                </Suspense>
            ) : (
                <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
                    <About />
                </Suspense>
            )}
        </main>
    );
}
```

#### Components
```javascript
// components/Banner.tsx
export function Banner() {
    return <div className="banner">Banner</div>;
}

// components/About.tsx
export default function About() {
    return <div className="about">About</div>;
}

// components/Home.tsx
export function Home() {
    return <div className="home">Home</div>;
}
```

### Explanation
1. **Lazy Loading**: The `lazy` function takes a function that returns a promise resolving to a module. It defers the loading of the component until it is actually rendered.
2. **Suspense Component**: Wraps the lazily loaded component and provides a `fallback` that is displayed while the module is being loaded.

### Building with Vite
When creating a production build using Vite (`pnpm run build`), the output shows that the initial bundle size is 46.5kb. The dynamically imported files (`Home.tsx` and `About.tsx`) are split into separate modules, reducing the initial bundle size.
```
> tsc && vite build

```

> Idea bundles to split are bundles whose size like 30kb, 50kb, or above — large bundles.


### Considerations
- **Bundle Size**: Ideal bundles for splitting are those above 30kb. Splitting small bundles can slow down the app.
- **Server-Side Rendering**: Code splitting and server-side rendering (SSR) should be used judiciously, considering metrics and user experience.

### Service Workers
Service workers can preload modules in the background, adding complexity but enhancing performance. Here's how to implement a service worker for preloading modules:

![Alt text](/public/service_worker.webp "Service Worker")

### Detailed Notes on Service Worker Setup and Module Preloading

**Overview**

The goal is to set up a service worker that preloads modules in the background to improve the performance of a React application by fetching resources in advance.

#### Steps:
1. **Set up a service worker**: Create and register the service worker.
2. **Generate a manifest file**: Use a build tool to generate a manifest file listing all modules/chunks.
3. **Preload modules**: Modify the service worker to preload modules based on the manifest file.

#### Complete Example:

1. **Create the Service Worker File**

   Create `public/service-worker.js` in your project:

   ```javascript
   // public/service-worker.js

   const CACHE_NAME = 'module-cache-v1';

   // Install event - Precache manifest assets
   self.addEventListener('install', event => {
     console.log('Service Worker installing.');

     event.waitUntil(
       caches.open(CACHE_NAME).then(cache => {
         return fetch('/asset-manifest.json')
           .then(response => response.json())
           .then(assets => {
             const urlsToCache = Object.values(assets);
             return cache.addAll(urlsToCache);
           });
       })
     );
     self.skipWaiting();
   });

   // Activate event - Clean up old caches if necessary
   self.addEventListener('activate', event => {
     console.log('Service Worker activating.');

     const cacheWhitelist = [CACHE_NAME];

     event.waitUntil(
       caches.keys().then(cacheNames => {
         return Promise.all(
           cacheNames.map(cacheName => {
             if (cacheWhitelist.indexOf(cacheName) === -1) {
               return caches.delete(cacheName);
             }
           })
         );
       })
     );
   });

   // Fetch event - Serve from cache if available
   self.addEventListener('fetch', event => {
     event.respondWith(
       caches.match(event.request).then(response => {
         return response || fetch(event.request);
       })
     );
   });
   ```

2. **Register the Service Worker**

   In your React app's entry point, typically `src/index.js`, register the service worker:

   ```javascript
   // src/index.js
   import React from 'react';
   import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
   import App from './App';

   if ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {
     window.addEventListener('load', () => {
       navigator.serviceWorker.register('/service-worker.js')
         .then(registration => {
           console.log('Service Worker registered with scope:', registration.scope);
         }).catch(error => {
           console.error('Service Worker registration failed:', error);
         });
     });
   }

   const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
   root.render(<App />);
   ```

3. **Generate a Manifest File**

   Use a build tool to generate a manifest file listing all modules. Here's an example using Webpack:

   First, install the plugin:

   ```bash
   npm install webpack-manifest-plugin --save-dev
   ```

   Then, configure Webpack to use the plugin:

   ```javascript
   // webpack.config.js
   const { WebpackManifestPlugin } = require('webpack-manifest-plugin');

   module.exports = {
     // ... other configuration settings
     plugins: [
       new WebpackManifestPlugin({
         fileName: 'asset-manifest.json',
       }),
     ],
   };
   ```

   Build your project to generate the `asset-manifest.json` file, which lists all the modules.

4. **Preload Modules in the Background**

   Modify the service worker to preload these modules when the app loads. Update the `service-worker.js` to fetch the modules listed in the manifest file:

   ```javascript
   // public/service-worker.js
   self.addEventListener('install', event => {
     console.log('Service Worker installing.');
     self.skipWaiting();

     event.waitUntil(
       caches.open('module-cache').then(cache => {
         return fetch('/asset-manifest.json')
           .then(response => response.json())
           .then(assets => {
             const urlsToCache = Object.values(assets);
             return cache.addAll(urlsToCache);
           });
       })
     );
   });

   self.addEventListener('activate', event => {
     console.log('Service Worker activating.');
   });

   self.addEventListener('fetch', event => {
     event.respondWith(
       caches.match(event.request).then(response => {
         return response || fetch(event.request);
       })
     );
   });
   ```

#### Explanation:

1. **Service Worker Setup**:
    - The service worker is registered when the app loads.
    - It logs messages during installation and activation for debugging purposes.
    - It handles fetch events by attempting to serve cached responses first.

2. **Generating the Manifest File**:
    - The Webpack configuration includes the `WebpackManifestPlugin`, which generates an `asset-manifest.json` file listing all the modules.

3. **Preloading Modules**:
    - During the `install` event, the service worker fetches the manifest file.
    - It extracts the URLs of the modules and caches them.
    - Subsequent fetch requests are intercepted by the service worker, which serves the cached modules if available, reducing the need to fetch them from the network.

This approach ensures that modules are preloaded in the background, providing a smoother and faster user experience when navigating your application【9:0†source】.

### Changing Service Worker Versions

After you build your application and deploy it, updating the service worker to change versions involves several key steps:

1. **Update the Service Worker File**:
    - To trigger a version update, modify the service worker file (e.g., `service-worker.js`). This could involve changing its content or updating the cache name.
    - A common practice is to update the `CACHE_NAME` variable to a new version number (e.g., from `module-cache-v1` to `module-cache-v2`). This signals the browser that there is a new version of the cache that needs to be used.

2. **Rebuild and Deploy**:
    - After updating the service worker file, rebuild your application using your build tool (e.g., Webpack).
    - Deploy the updated build artifacts (including the new service worker file) to your server or hosting platform.

3. **Service Worker Update Process**:
    - **Browser Detection**: When users visit your site after deployment, the browser detects that the service worker file has changed.
    - **Installation**: The browser downloads the updated service worker file. The `install` event is fired for the new service worker.
    - **Waiting**: By default, the new service worker enters a waiting phase if an existing service worker is still active.
    - **Activation**: Once the old service worker is no longer controlling any pages (or if `self.skipWaiting()` is used), the new service worker is activated. The `activate` event is fired for the new service worker.

#### Detailed Steps:

1. **Modify the Service Worker**:

   Example: Updating `CACHE_NAME`

   ```javascript
   // service-worker.js
   const CACHE_NAME = 'module-cache-v2';  // Increment version

   self.addEventListener('install', event => {
     console.log('Service Worker installing.');

     event.waitUntil(
       caches.open(CACHE_NAME).then(cache => {
         return cache.addAll([
           '/',
           '/index.html',
           '/styles.css',
           '/script.js'
         ]);
       })
     );
     self.skipWaiting();  // Activate the new version immediately
   });

   self.addEventListener('activate', event => {
     console.log('Service Worker activating.');

     const cacheWhitelist = [CACHE_NAME];

     event.waitUntil(
       caches.keys().then(cacheNames => {
         return Promise.all(
           cacheNames.map(cacheName => {
             if (cacheWhitelist.indexOf(cacheName) === -1) {
               return caches.delete(cacheName);
             }
           })
         );
       })
     );
   });
   ```

2. **Rebuild the Application**:

   Use your build tool to generate the new build files, which include the updated service worker file.

   ```bash
   npm run build  # For example, if using a script in package.json
   ```

3. **Deploy the Updated Build**:

   Upload the new build files to your server or deployment platform.

4. **Service Worker Update Flow**:
    - **Visit Site**: When a user visits your site, the browser detects the updated service worker file.
    - **Install Event**: The new service worker is installed, and the `install` event is triggered.
    - **Skip Waiting**: If `self.skipWaiting()` is used, the new service worker activates immediately. Otherwise, it will wait until the old service worker is no longer in use.

By following these steps, you set up a service worker that preloads modules in the background, providing a more efficient and responsive React application.

### `createRoot` and `hydrateRoot` in React

Both `createRoot` and `hydrateRoot` are methods used in React for managing the rendering lifecycle of a React application, but they serve different purposes based on how the initial HTML is generated.

#### `createRoot`

**Purpose:** Used for client-side rendering in React applications where the HTML is generated by React from scratch.

**Usage:**
1. **Create a Root:**
   ```javascript
   import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';

   const domNode = document.getElementById('root');
   const root = createRoot(domNode);
   ```

2. **Render Components:**
   ```javascript
   root.render(<App />);
   ```

3. **Unmount (if needed):**
   ```javascript
   root.unmount();
   ```

**Parameters:**
- `domNode`: The DOM element where the React components will be rendered.
- `options` (optional): An object with optional settings, including:
  - `onCaughtError`: Callback for errors caught by Error Boundaries.
  - `onUncaughtError`: Callback for errors not caught by Error Boundaries.
  - `onRecoverableError`: Callback for errors React can recover from.
  - `identifierPrefix`: Prefix for IDs generated by `useId`.

**Returns:**
- An object with methods `render` and `unmount`.

**Caveats:**
- If the app is server-rendered, use `hydrateRoot` instead.
- Typically, you will only need one `createRoot` call for a fully React-managed app.

**Example:**
```javascript
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';
import App from './App';

const root = createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<App />);
```

#### `hydrateRoot`

**Purpose:** Used for hydrating server-rendered HTML. It attaches React to existing HTML that was rendered by React on the server, ensuring the React components take over and manage the existing HTML content.

**Usage:**
1. **Hydrate a Root:**
   ```javascript
   import { hydrateRoot } from 'react-dom/client';

   const domNode = document.getElementById('root');
   const root = hydrateRoot(domNode, <App />);
   ```

2. **Render Components (optional):**
   ```javascript
   root.render(<App />);
   ```

3. **Unmount (if needed):**
   ```javascript
   root.unmount();
   ```

**Parameters:**
- `domNode`: The DOM element containing the server-rendered HTML.
- `reactNode`: The React component to hydrate the existing HTML.
- `options` (optional): Similar to `createRoot`, including:
  - `onCaughtError`
  - `onUncaughtError`
  - `onRecoverableError`
  - `identifierPrefix`

**Returns:**
- An object with methods `render` and `unmount`.

**Caveats:**
- The content rendered by React needs to match the server-rendered HTML exactly to avoid hydration errors.
- If there's a mismatch between the server-rendered content and the React component output, React may issue warnings or errors.

**Example:**
```javascript
import { hydrateRoot } from 'react-dom/client';
import App from './App';

hydrateRoot(document.getElementById('root'), <App />);
```

### Summary
- **`createRoot`** is for client-side rendering where React creates and manages the HTML from scratch.
- **`hydrateRoot`** is for server-side rendering where React attaches itself to pre-rendered HTML provided by the server.

# Tree shaking 

Tree shaking is a technique used in modern JavaScript bundlers (like Webpack, Rollup, or Parcel) to eliminate unused code from the final output bundle. Here's how it works and why it helps in reducing bundle sizes:

1. **Static Analysis**: Tree shaking relies on static analysis of the code to determine which parts of the code are actually used. It examines import and export statements to figure out which modules and functions are in use.

2. **Dead Code Elimination**: By identifying which pieces of code are not being used (i.e., "dead code"), tree shaking can remove these unused parts from the final bundle. This reduces the overall size of the bundle because unnecessary code is not included.

3. **ES6 Modules**: Tree shaking works best with ES6 module syntax (`import` and `export`) because it allows for static analysis. Unlike CommonJS modules (which use `require` and `module.exports`), ES6 modules have a more predictable structure that makes it easier for bundlers to determine what code is used and what isn’t.

4. **Minification**: In conjunction with minification tools, tree shaking helps further reduce bundle sizes by removing dead code and compressing the remaining code, leading to more efficient and smaller bundles.

**Example:**

Consider a module with several utility functions:

```js
// utils.js
export function usefulFunction() {
  // some code
}

export function unusedFunction() {
  // some code
}
```

If your application only imports `usefulFunction`:

```js
import { usefulFunction } from './utils';
```

A tree-shaking capable bundler will detect that `unusedFunction` is not used anywhere in the codebase and will exclude it from the final bundle. As a result, the output bundle will be smaller because it doesn't include `unusedFunction`.

**Benefits:**

- **Reduced Bundle Size**: By removing unused code, tree shaking helps decrease the size of the final JavaScript bundle, leading to faster load times and better performance.
- **Improved Efficiency**: Smaller bundles mean less data for users to download and less work for the browser to parse and execute, improving overall application speed and efficiency.

In summary, tree shaking helps optimize your application by ensuring that only the code that is actually used is included in the final bundle, thereby reducing its size and improving performance.

# API Call Performance Optimization

### Optimization Techniques:
1. **State Management**: Efficiently manage application state to avoid unnecessary API calls.
2. **Memoization**: Use `useMemo` to memoize functions or values to prevent re-calculations and re-fetches when dependencies haven’t changed.
3. **Debounce and Throttle**: Limit the frequency of API calls to improve performance.
4. **Lazy Loading**: Load components or data only when needed.
5. **Caching**: Store API responses locally to avoid redundant requests.
6. **Pagination**: Fetch data in chunks to reduce the amount of data loaded at once.
7. **Reduce Component Rerenders**: Use `React.memo`, `PureComponent`, or `useMemo` to avoid unnecessary re-renders caused by state or prop changes.
