### How to Manage State in a React App

#### What is State in React?

**Functional Component:** JavaScript functions, independent and reusable bits of code.

- The purpose of building applications with components is to have a modular architecture with a clear separation of concerns.
- Plain JavaScript functions don't have the ability to store information. The code within them executes and "disappears" once the execution is finished.

However, thanks to state, React functional components can store information even after execution. It's important to mention that not all components in a React app must have state. There are stateless components as well, which just render their content without the need to store any information, and that's perfectly fine.

Another important point is that state change is one of the two things that make a React component re-render (the other being a change in props). In this way, the state stores information about the component and also controls its behavior.

To implement state in our components, React provides us with a hook called `useState`:

```jsx
const [state, setState] = useState();
```

- `setState` function is asynchronous:

    ```jsx
    <button onClick={() => {
        setCount(count + 1);
        console.log(count); // this gives the previous value of the state, without the update.
    }}>Add 1</button>
    ```

    **Correct way for reading state:**

    ```jsx
    useEffect(() => console.log(value), [value]);
    ```

**Problem:** Consider the case where a user presses the "Add" button many times in a row, or a loop that emits a click event a certain number of times.

By updating state like `setCount(count + 1)`, we risk that `count` won't be updated when the next event is fired.

A more defensive approach is to pass `setCount` a callback, like so:

```jsx
setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1);
```

This ensures that the value to update is the most recent one and keeps us away from the problem mentioned above.

**Note:** Every time we perform updates on a previous state, we should use this approach.

### Problems with the `useState` Hook

1. **Prop Drilling:**
   - When we have many nested components, we may need to pass props through multiple component levels to reach the required siblings.
   - The solution is to "lift" the state up, but this makes the code ugly and hard to understand. This is known as "prop drilling."
   - Prop drilling can also cause unnecessary re-renders, affecting the performance of our app.
   - A solution to this is to use React context, which creates a wrapper component that wraps around any group of components we want, passing props directly to those components without drilling through components that won’t necessarily use that state.

    *Note:* When using context, it's essential to consider whether all the wrapped components need to re-render when the context state changes, as it may cause performance issues.

2. **State Changes Depending on Previous State:**
   - When using `useState`, where the new state to be set depends on the previous state (like our `count` example) or when state changes occur very frequently, `useState` may provoke unexpected and unpredictable behavior.
   - In these cases, reducers solve this problem.

---

### `useReducer` Hook

A reducer is a pure function that takes the previous state and an action as an argument and returns the next state. It's called a reducer because it's the same function type you could pass to an array: `Array.prototype.reduce(reducer, initialValue)`.

`useReducer` is the hook React provides to let us implement reducers to manage our state.

**Example:**

```jsx
// App.js
import { useReducer } from 'react';
import './App.scss';

function App() {

  function reducer(state, action) {
    switch (action.type) {
      case 'ADD': return { count: state.count + 1 };
      case 'SUB': return { count: state.count - 1 };
      case 'ADD10': return { count: state.count + 10 };
      case 'SUB10': return { count: state.count - 10 };
      case 'RESET': return { count: 0 };
      default: return state;
    }
  }

  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, { count: 0 });

  return (
    <div className="App">
      <p>Count is: {state.count}</p>

      <div>
        <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'ADD' })}>Add 1</button>
        <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'SUB' })}>Decrease 1</button>
        <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'ADD10' })}>Add 10</button>
        <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'SUB10' })}>Decrease 10</button>
        <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'RESET' })}>Reset count</button>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

> It's common practice to use switch statements on reducers and capital letters to declare the actions. ;)

To sum it up, we just need:

- A reducer, that is the function that will consolidate all possible state changes
- A dispatch function, that will send the modifying actions to the reducer.

The thing here is that the UI elements won't be able to update the state directly like they did before when calling setState with a value. Now they will have to call an action type and go through the reducer, which makes state management more modular and predictable. ;)

### Redux (Library)

Redux is an agnostic library, meaning it can be implemented in any front-end application, not just React. Redux is a tool that solves both of the problems mentioned before (prop drilling and unpredictable state behavior on frequent and complex state changes).

The Redux set of tools is very similar to what we've seen with `useReducer`, but with a few more components:

1. **A store** — an object that holds the app state data.
2. **A reducer** — a function that returns some state data, triggered by an action type.
3. **An action** — an object that tells the reducer how to change the state. It must contain a `type` property, and it can contain an optional `payload` property.

**Example:**

```jsx
// App.js
import './App.scss';

import { Provider, useSelector, useDispatch } from 'react-redux';
import { addOne, subOne, addSome, subSome, reset } from './store/actions/count.actions';

import store from './store';

function App() {

  const dispatch = useDispatch();
  const count = useSelector(state => state.count);

  return (
    <Provider store={store}>
      <div className="App">
        <p>Count is: {count}</p>

        <div>
          <button onClick={() => dispatch(addOne())}>Add 1</button>
          <button onClick={() => dispatch(subOne())}>Decrease 1</button>
          <button onClick={() => dispatch(addSome(10))}>Add 10</button>
          <button onClick={() => dispatch(subSome(10))}>Decrease 10</button>
          <button onClick={() => dispatch(reset())}>Reset count</button>
        </div>
      </div>
    </Provider>
  );
}

export default App;
```

You would also need a new store directory with its corresponding store, reducer, and actions files:

```jsx
// index.js (STORE)
import { createStore } from 'redux';
import CountReducer from './reducers/count.reducer';

export default createStore(CountReducer);

// count.reducer.js
import { ADD, SUB, ADDSOME, SUBSOME, RESET } from '../actions/count.actions';

const CountReducer = (state = { count: 0 }, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case ADD: return { count: state.count + 1 };
    case SUB: return { count: state.count - 1 };
    case ADDSOME: return { count: state.count + action.payload };
    case SUBSOME: return { count: state.count - action.payload };
    case RESET: return { count: 0 };
    default: return state;
  }
};

export default CountReducer;

// count.actions.js
export const ADD = 'ADD';
export const addOne = () => ({ type: ADD });

export const SUB = 'SUB';
export const subOne = () => ({ type: SUB });

export const ADDSOME = 'ADDSOME';
export const addSome = (value) => ({
  type: ADDSOME,
  payload: value
});

export const SUBSOME = 'SUBSOME';
export const subSome = (value) => ({
  type: SUBSOME,
  payload: value
});

export const RESET = 'RESET';
export const reset = () => ({ type: RESET });
```

**Key Points:**

- Redux is an external library, so before anything, you need to install it by running `npm i redux react-redux`.
- Redux provides tools to manage state and allows you to access the store from any component.
- To create a store, we import the createStore function and pass it a reducer as input.
Know that you can also combine different reducers and pass it to the same store in case you'd like to separate concerns into different reducers.

> And last comes our component. Here we have 3 things to notice:
> - First we have a provider component that receives store as props. This is what grants access to our store from all the components wrapped in it.
> - Then we have a hook called useDispatch() (that we'll use to dispatch actions) and another called useSelector() (that we'll use to read the state from the store).
> - Last, notice we're dispatching the functions we declared on the actions file, and passing a value as an input when it corresponds. This value is what the actions takes as payload and what the reducer is going to use to modify the state. ;)

An important thing to mention here is that these tools or ways to manage state aren't mutually exclusive, they can and probably should be used at the same time, each to solve the specific problem they're good at.

> **A good golden rule is useState for component state, Redux for application state.**

### Redux Toolkit

Redux Toolkit is a library built on top of Redux, which aims to take away some of the complexity and boilerplate that Redux generates. 

Redux Toolkit is built upon two things:

1. **A store** — which works exactly the same as a plain Redux store.
2. **Slices** — which condense plain Redux actions and reducers into a single thing.

**Example:**

```jsx
// App.js
import './App.scss';

import { useSelector, useDispatch } from 'react-redux';
import { addOne, subOne, addSome, subSome, reset } from './store/slices/count.slice';

function App() {

  const dispatch = useDispatch();
  const count = useSelector(state => state.counter.count);

  return (
    <div className="App">
      <p>Count is: {count}</p>

      <div>
        <button onClick={() => dispatch(addOne())}>Add 1</button>
        <button onClick={() => dispatch(subOne())}>Decrease 1</button>
       

 <button onClick={() => dispatch(addSome(10))}>Add 10</button>
        <button onClick={() => dispatch(subSome(10))}>Decrease 10</button>
        <button onClick={() => dispatch(reset())}>Reset count</button>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

You would also need a new store directory with its corresponding store and slice files:

```jsx
// index.js (STORE)
import { configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';
import CountSlice from './slices/count.slice';

export default configureStore({
  reducer: {
    counter: CountSlice
  }
});

// count.slice.js
import { createSlice } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';

export const CountSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'counter',
  initialState: {
    count: 0
  },
  reducers: {
    addOne: (state) => { state.count += 1 },
    subOne: (state) => { state.count -= 1 },
    addSome: (state, action) => { state.count += action.payload },
    subSome: (state, action) => { state.count -= action.payload },
    reset: (state) => { state.count = 0 }
  }
});

export const { addOne, subOne, addSome, subSome, reset } = CountSlice.actions;
export default CountSlice.reducer;
```

**Key Points:**

- First we need to install it by running npm install @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux
- Redux Toolkit condenses everything in such a way that it avoids many repetitions and boilerplate, making it easier and faster to implement Redux.
- It allows for very complex state management. While not necessary for smaller projects, it's highly beneficial for bigger projects.

- Redux toolkit aims to be a simpler way to deal with Redux, but in my opinion it's still almost the same boilerplate and not much of a difference with plain Redux.

> Redux thunk and Redux Saga are other two popular middleware libraries that are used together with Redux.
> Specifically, both Thunk and Saga are meant to be used when dealing with side effects or assynchronous tasks.

### Recoil

Recoil is an open-source state management library specifically designed for React by Facebook (now Meta). It aims to be "minimal and reactish," meaning it closely aligns with the look and feel of native React code. Recoil's core concept revolves around **atoms**, which represent pieces of state that can be accessed and modified by any component. Components reading an atom automatically subscribe to its updates, ensuring that any changes trigger a re-render of those components.

An example using Recoil might involve defining an atom for a counter, then using the `useRecoilState` hook to access and modify this state within a component. The syntax is quite similar to React's `useState` hook, making it straightforward for React developers to adopt.

### Installation and Usage

To use Recoil, you need to install it using `npm install recoil`, wrap your app with the `RecoilRoot` component, and define atoms using the `atom` function. The state is managed via the `useRecoilState` hook, allowing components to read and update the state.

### Jotai

Jotai is another open-source state management library for React, inspired by Recoil but with an even more minimalistic approach. It doesn't use string keys and is more TypeScript-oriented. Like Recoil, Jotai's central concept is the **atom**, which represents a piece of state. The syntax is similar but even more minimal than Recoil, focusing on simplicity and ease of use.

### Zustand

Zustand is another state management library for React, inspired by Flux. It aims to provide a small, fast, non-opinionated, and scalable state management solution with minimal boilerplate. Zustand uses a store concept similar to Redux, but the store is implemented as a hook, simplifying the state management process. The library is designed to be efficient and easy to use, reducing the complexity often associated with state management.

### Conclusion

State management in React is a complex topic, with many tools available to address different challenges. While Redux remains the most mature and widely used, it introduces significant complexity. Modern alternatives like Recoil, Jotai, and Zustand offer simpler, more straightforward solutions, but they are still relatively new and not as widely adopted or tested.

For most use cases, React's built-in hooks like `useState`, `useReducer`, and `useContext` are sufficient. However, for larger and more complex applications, a dedicated state management library may be necessary. The choice between these tools often comes down to balancing reliability and simplicity, with newer libraries offering a cleaner API but potentially less community support and maturity compared to Redux.

Know that you can also combine different reducers and pass it to the same store in case you'd like to separate concerns into different reducers.
