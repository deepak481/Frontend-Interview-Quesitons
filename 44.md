### Keeping Components Pure

1. Introduction to Pure Components

React components should be pure functions. This means they should:
- Only perform calculations and return JSX
- Not change any pre-existing objects or variables
- Always return the same output for the same inputs

Example of a pure function:
```javascript
function double(number) {
  return 2 * number;
}
```

2. Components as Formulas

React components can be thought of as formulas, similar to mathematical equations. They should always produce the same result given the same inputs.

Example:
```javascript
function Recipe({ drinkers }) {
  return (
    <ol>    
      <li>Boil {drinkers} cups of water.</li>
      <li>Add {drinkers} spoons of tea and {0.5 * drinkers} spoons of spice.</li>
      <li>Add {0.5 * drinkers} cups of milk to boil and sugar to taste.</li>
    </ol>
  );
}
```

This `Recipe` component will always return the same JSX for a given number of `drinkers`.

3. Side Effects and Impure Components

Side effects are changes to objects or variables that existed before rendering. They make components impure and can lead to unpredictable behavior.

Example of an impure component:
```javascript
let guest = 0;

function Cup() {
  guest = guest + 1; // Bad: changing a pre-existing variable
  return <h2>Tea cup for guest #{guest}</h2>;
}
```

To fix this, pass `guest` as a prop:
```javascript
function Cup({ guest }) {
  return <h2>Tea cup for guest #{guest}</h2>;
}
```

4. Strict Mode and Detecting Impure Calculations

React's Strict Mode helps detect impure components by calling each component's function twice during development. This helps identify components that rely on or modify external state.

5. Local Mutation

It's okay to change variables and objects created within the component during rendering. This is called "local mutation."

Example:
```javascript
function TeaGathering() {
  let cups = [];
  for (let i = 1; i <= 12; i++) {
    cups.push(<Cup key={i} guest={i} />);
  }
  return cups;
}
```

6. Handling Side Effects

Side effects should be performed in:
- Event handlers (preferred)
- useEffect hooks (as a last resort)

Try to express logic through rendering alone when possible.

7. Importance of Purity in React

Pure components enable:
- Server-side rendering
- Performance optimizations through skipping unnecessary renders
- Partial rendering of component trees
- New React features that rely on components being pure

8. Recap and Best Practices

- Components should be pure, not changing pre-existing objects or variables
- Same inputs should always produce the same output
- Rendering can happen at any time, so components shouldn't depend on each other's rendering sequence
- Don't mutate props, state, or context directly; use setState to update the screen
- Express component logic in the returned JSX when possible
- Use event handlers for changes, and useEffect as a last resort
- Writing pure functions takes practice but unlocks the full potential of React's paradigm

By following these principles, you can create more predictable, maintainable, and efficient React applications.
