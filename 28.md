## What is lexical scope
Lexical scope in JavaScript refers to the scope chain determined by the structure of the code at the time of declaration. It dictates the visibility and accessibility of variables within nested functions based on their lexical environment.


# Pure Function

### Understanding Pure Functions

Pure functions are essential for functional programming, reliable concurrency, and React+Redux apps. A pure function has two main characteristics:
1. **Deterministic**: Given the same input, it always returns the same output.
2. **No Side Effects**: It does not modify any external state.

### What is a Function?

A function is a process that takes input (arguments) and produces output (return value). Functions can serve multiple purposes:
- **Mapping**: Producing output based on given inputs.
- **Procedures**: Performing a sequence of steps (procedural programming).
- **I/O**: Communicating with other system parts (screen, storage, logs, network).

### Mapping

Pure functions map input arguments to return values. For example, `Math.max(2, 8, 5)` returns `8`.

### Pure Functions

A pure function always returns the same output for the same input and has no side effects. For instance, `const double = x => x * 2;` is pure because `double(5)` always returns `10`.

### Impurity in Functions

Impure functions produce different outputs for the same input or have side effects. For example:
- `Math.random()` generates different numbers each time, making it impure.
- A function interacting with the current time, like `const time = () => new Date().toLocaleTimeString();`, is also impure.

### Referential Transparency

Pure functions maintain referential transparency, meaning you can replace a function call with its output without changing the program's meaning.

### Avoiding Shared State

Pure functions do not rely on external mutable state, preventing issues like race conditions in concurrent environments.

### Immutability

Pure functions do not alter external state. They should not mutate objects or arrays passed as arguments. For instance, an impure `addToCart` function mutates the cart object, while a pure version would return a new cart object with the item added, maintaining immutability.

### Conclusion

Pure functions are fundamental in functional programming due to their simplicity, predictability, and ease of testing. They avoid bugs associated with shared mutable state and make programs more flexible and easier to refactor.
