### Multi-Page Applications (MPAs)

- **Description:** Each page of the website is a separate HTML file.
- **Navigation:** Navigating between pages requires a full page reload.
- **Example:** Traditional websites where each link leads to a new HTML page.

### Single Page Applications (SPAs)

- **Description:** A web application or website that dynamically rewrites the current page rather than loading entire new pages from the server.
- **Initial Load:** The initial HTML page is loaded from the server.
- **Subsequent Interactions:** Handled by JavaScript, which fetches data from the server and updates the DOM as needed, without requiring a full page reload.

### Evolution to SPAs

- **Pre-SPA Techniques:** Before dedicated SPA frameworks, developers used AJAX to create dynamic experiences.
  - **AJAX:** Allowed for partial page updates and a more responsive feel.
  - **Challenges:** Building complex SPAs with AJAX required manual management of data, UI, and navigation, which was cumbersome and error-prone.

### Benefits of SPAs

- **Efficient Loading:** 
  - Load all necessary files upfront.
  - Reduces loading times by not requesting extra files from the server as you navigate the site.

- **Server Load Reduction:** 
  - Lessens the strain on servers.
  - Potentially saves costs and resources as servers donâ€™t need to repeatedly generate pages.

- **Responsive Interactions:**
  - Offers snappy and responsive user experiences.
  - Updates only the necessary parts of the page without requiring full-page refreshes.

### Summary

- **MPAs:**
  - Each page is a separate HTML file.
  - Full page reload required for navigation.
  - Traditional approach with separate pages for each link.

- **SPAs:**
  - Dynamically rewrite the current page.
  - Initial page load from the server, subsequent interactions handled by JavaScript.
  - Efficient loading, reduced server load, and more responsive user interactions.
