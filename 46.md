### 1. **What is Render Hijacking in React?**

**Render Hijacking** refers to a technique where one component (usually a Higher-Order Component or HOC) takes control of the rendering output of another component. 

- **Higher-Order Component (HOC):** An HOC is a function that takes a component and returns a new component. It's used to add extra functionality or modify the behavior of the wrapped component.
  
- **Render Hijacking in Practice:** When you wrap a component with an HOC, the HOC can manipulate the props or state of the wrapped component, affecting what gets rendered. This might include modifying the output, adding conditional rendering, or injecting additional props.

For example, imagine a simple `Button` component that renders a button element. If you wrap it with an HOC that adds logging every time the button is clicked, the HOC is effectively hijacking the render process to inject this additional behavior.

**Why is it called "Hijacking"?** Because the HOC intercepts the render process of the original component and potentially changes what the component displays or how it behaves. The original component might not even know that its rendering logic has been altered.

### 2. **What will happen if you use `setState()` in the constructor?**

In React, the constructor is used to set up the initial state of the component. Here's why using `setState()` in the constructor is problematic:

- **Purpose of `setState()`:** `setState()` is used to update the state of a component and trigger a re-render. It is typically used after the component has mounted or when an event occurs that requires the UI to update.

- **Issue in the Constructor:** If you call `setState()` inside the constructor, React will try to re-render the component immediately. However, the component is still in the process of being constructed, so it hasn't been mounted to the DOM yet. This can lead to errors because React expects `setState()` to be called only when the component is ready to update.

- **Error Message:** You'll likely see an error like "Can only update a mounted or mounting component," because React is trying to re-render a component that isn't fully initialized.

- **Correct Approach:** Instead of using `setState()` in the constructor, you should initialize the state directly by assigning an object to `this.state` within the constructor. This sets the initial state without triggering a re-render.

```javascript
constructor(props) {
    super(props); // Always call super(props) when defining the constructor of a class component.
    this.state = {
        // initialize state here
    };
}
```

### 3. **What are Synthetic Events in React?**

Synthetic Events are a cross-browser wrapper around native browser events, ensuring that events in React work consistently across different environments.

- **Why Synthetic Events?** Different browsers sometimes handle events differently, which can lead to inconsistencies in how your application behaves. React abstracts these differences by using synthetic events, which normalize event properties across all browsers.

- **Behavior:** Synthetic events work similarly to native events but offer a consistent API that you can rely on. For instance, the `onClick` handler in React uses a synthetic event to ensure that the event's properties (like `target`, `currentTarget`, etc.) are the same across all browsers.

- **Example:**
  ```javascript
  function handleClick(event) {
      console.log(event.target); // Consistent behavior across browsers
  }

  <button onClick={handleClick}>Click me</button>
  ```

- **Not One-to-One Mapping:** It's important to note that synthetic events are not a direct one-to-one mapping of native browser events. They are pooled, meaning that the event object is reused for performance reasons, so if you need to work with the event asynchronously, you should call `event.persist()` to keep the event around.

### 4. **What are Portals in React?**

Portals provide a way to render components outside of their parent component's DOM hierarchy while still keeping the React context.

- **Use Case:** Imagine you have a modal that you want to display on top of everything else in your application. Normally, the modal would be rendered inside the DOM hierarchy of its parent component. But using a portal, you can render the modal outside of this hierarchy, directly in the `body` or another DOM node, while still keeping it logically connected to the parent component.

- **How to Create a Portal:**
  ```javascript
  import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

  ReactDOM.createPortal(child, container);
  ```

  - `child`: The React element you want to render.
  - `container`: The DOM element where the child should be rendered.

- **Example:**
  ```javascript
  const modalRoot = document.getElementById('modal-root');

  function Modal({ children }) {
      return ReactDOM.createPortal(
          children,
          modalRoot
      );
  }
  ```

- **Why Use Portals?** Portals are useful when you need to break out of the component hierarchy for styling or functional reasons, like modals, tooltips, or dropdowns that need to overlay other components.

### 5. **What is Reconciliation in React?**

Reconciliation is the process React uses to update the DOM when a component's state or props change.

- **How It Works:** When a component's state or props change, React needs to determine how to update the DOM to reflect these changes. Instead of re-rendering the entire DOM (which would be inefficient), React creates a virtual DOM, which is a lightweight copy of the actual DOM.

- **Comparison Process:** React compares the virtual DOM with the previous version (a process called "diffing") to find out which parts have changed. Once it has identified the differences, it updates only the necessary parts of the actual DOM. This approach is much faster than re-rendering everything from scratch.

- **Efficiency:** The straightforward comparison of two DOM trees would have a time complexity of O(nÂ³), which is too slow for practical use. To optimize this, React uses a heuristic approach that breaks the problem down into simpler parts, making the diffing process much faster.

- **Why It Matters:** Reconciliation is key to React's performance. By updating only the parts of the DOM that have changed, React can make your applications run faster and more efficiently.

These concepts form the foundation of how React manages rendering and updates, helping to create fast, responsive applications.

### 6. **Why Does React Use `className` Instead of `class`?**

In React, when you want to add CSS classes to an element, you use the `className` attribute instead of `class`. Here's why:

- **JavaScript Keyword:** In JavaScript, `class` is a reserved keyword used for defining classes (as in class-based programming). Since JSX (JavaScript XML) is an extension of JavaScript, using `class` as an attribute name would create a conflict or ambiguity in the code.

- **JSX is JavaScript:** JSX allows you to write HTML-like syntax within your JavaScript code. Since `class` is a keyword in JavaScript, using it directly in JSX could confuse the JavaScript engine. To avoid this, React uses `className` instead, which doesn't conflict with the JavaScript `class` keyword.

- **Practical Example:**
  ```javascript
  render() {   
    return <span className={'menunavigation-menu'}>{'Menu'}</span>;
  }
  ```
  In this example, `className` is used to apply the CSS class `menunavigation-menu` to the `span` element.

- **Consistency:** By using `className`, React ensures that your JSX code is consistent with standard JavaScript, avoiding potential issues or confusion.

### 7. **What is React Fiber?**

React Fiber is a reimplementation of the core rendering algorithm in React. It was introduced in React 16 to address some limitations of the previous rendering engine.

- **Why the Change?** The previous React rendering engine (often referred to as the "stack reconciler") handled updates synchronously, meaning that once a render started, it couldn't be interrupted. This worked well for many use cases but struggled with complex applications where rendering could take a long time, leading to performance issues and janky animations.

- **What is Fiber?** React Fiber is essentially a new architecture that allows React to pause, resume, and prioritize rendering tasks. It breaks down the rendering work into small units called "fibers," which can be processed incrementally.

- **Core Idea:** With Fiber, React can split rendering work into smaller chunks and spread it over multiple frames. This means React can start rendering, then pause to handle more urgent tasks (like responding to user input), and resume rendering later.

- **Relation to Reconciliation:** Fiber is also the new implementation of the reconciliation algorithm. It allows React to update the user interface more smoothly and efficiently, particularly in applications with complex UIs or where performance is critical.

### 8. **What is the Goal of React Fiber?**

The primary goal of React Fiber is to enhance React's performance and adaptability, particularly for complex user interfaces and animations. Here's how it achieves this:

- **Incremental Rendering:** The headline feature of Fiber is incremental rendering. This means that instead of trying to render the entire UI in one go, React can break down the rendering process into smaller parts. This allows React to spread the rendering work across multiple frames, improving the responsiveness of the application.

- **Handling Complex Scenarios:** React Fiber makes it easier to handle complex scenarios like animations, layouts, and gestures. These scenarios often require more fine-grained control over rendering, which Fiber provides.

- **Prioritization:** Fiber allows React to prioritize certain updates over others. For example, user input (like typing or clicking) can be prioritized over less critical updates (like background animations). This prioritization helps make applications feel faster and more responsive.

- **Better User Experience:** By managing rendering tasks more efficiently, Fiber helps prevent the UI from freezing or becoming unresponsive during heavy computation or complex updates. This leads to a smoother, more fluid user experience.

In summary, React Fiber is a significant upgrade to the React rendering engine, designed to make React more suitable for modern web applications that require high performance and responsiveness, particularly in areas like animations, complex layouts, and real-time user interactions.

### 9. **Why Are Fragments Better Than Container `div`s?**

When working with React, you often need to return multiple elements from a component. Traditionally, developers used a container `div` to wrap these elements. However, React introduced **Fragments** as a better alternative. Hereâs why:

- **Performance:** Fragments are a bit faster than container `div`s because they donât create an extra DOM node. Every `div` added to the DOM consumes memory and requires additional processing by the browser. While this might not be noticeable in small components, it can make a difference in applications with large, deep component trees.

- **Cleaner HTML:** Using Fragments keeps the DOM tree cleaner and less cluttered. Extra `div` elements can make the HTML structure harder to read and debug. With Fragments, the elements are siblings in the DOM without unnecessary wrappers.

- **CSS Layouts:** Certain CSS layout techniques, like Flexbox and CSS Grid, rely on a specific parent-child relationship between elements. Introducing unnecessary `div`s can break these layouts or make them harder to manage. For instance, adding a `div` inside a Flexbox container can create an unwanted flex item, which may disrupt the layout. Fragments avoid this issue by not adding any extra elements to the DOM.

- **Better Developer Experience:** When inspecting the DOM using browser tools, youâll find less clutter, making it easier to understand the structure of your app. This can be particularly beneficial during debugging.

**Example of Using a Fragment:**
```javascript
function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <React.Fragment>
      <h1>Title</h1>
      <p>Description</p>
    </React.Fragment>
  );
}
```
Or using the shorthand syntax:
```javascript
function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>Title</h1>
      <p>Description</p>
    </>
  );
}
```

### 10. **What Are the Limitations of React?**

While React is a powerful library, it has some limitations:

- **Just a View Library:** React focuses solely on the "View" in the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture. It doesn't provide out-of-the-box solutions for routing, state management, or data fetching. You need to rely on additional libraries like React Router, Redux, or Context API for a complete framework-like experience.

- **Learning Curve:** React introduces concepts like JSX, component-based architecture, and hooks, which can be challenging for beginners, especially those new to web development. Understanding how React works internally, like reconciliation and state management, adds to the learning curve.

- **Integration with Traditional MVC Frameworks:** Integrating React into a traditional MVC framework (like Ruby on Rails or Django) often requires additional configuration and setup. Since React is just a view library, you need to handle data management, routing, and other concerns separately, which can complicate integration.

- **Code Complexity:** JSX combines HTML and JavaScript, making the code harder to read and maintain, especially for larger applications. Inline templating with JSX can lead to complex and deeply nested code, which can be difficult to debug and refactor.

- **Over-Engineering:** React encourages breaking down the UI into small, reusable components. However, this can sometimes lead to over-engineering, where you have too many tiny components, increasing the complexity and making the codebase harder to manage.

### 11. **How to Create Props Proxy for HOC Components?**

A **Props Proxy** pattern allows you to manipulate the props passed to a wrapped component in a Higher-Order Component (HOC). This is useful for adding, modifying, or filtering props before passing them down to the wrapped component.

**Example of a Props Proxy HOC:**
```javascript
function HOC(WrappedComponent) {
    return class extends React.Component {
        render() {
            // Add or modify props
            const newProps = { 
                title: 'New Header', 
                footer: false, 
                showFeatureX: false, 
                showFeatureY: true 
            };

            // Pass down original and new props
            return <WrappedComponent {...this.props} {...newProps} />;
        }
    }
}
```

- **How It Works:** The HOC wraps the `WrappedComponent`, and inside the `render` method, you can add or modify props. The `newProps` object contains the modified or additional props. The `WrappedComponent` is rendered with both the original props (`this.props`) and the new or modified props (`newProps`).

- **Use Case:** Props proxies are particularly useful when you want to enforce certain prop values or add common functionality to multiple components without modifying each component individually.

### 12. **What Happens if You Use Props in the Initial State?**

Using props to initialize the state of a component can lead to unexpected behavior:

- **Initialization Only:** When you use props to initialize state inside a component, the initialization happens only onceâwhen the component is first created. This means that if the parent component updates the prop later, the state inside the child component won't automatically update to reflect this change.

**Example:**
```javascript
function SomeComponent(props) {
    const [count, setCount] = useState(props.count);
}
```
- **Potential Issue:** If `props.count` changes later, `count` inside `SomeComponent` will not update because `useState` only sets the initial state. This can lead to inconsistencies between the parentâs state and the childâs state.

- **Better Approach:** If you need the state to update whenever the prop changes, you should use the `useEffect` hook to watch for changes in the prop and update the state accordingly.

**Example with `useEffect`:**
```javascript
function SomeComponent(props) {
    const [count, setCount] = useState(props.count);

    useEffect(() => {
        setCount(props.count);
    }, [props.count]); // This effect runs whenever props.count changes
}
```
This way, the state `count` in `SomeComponent` will update whenever `props.count` changes, keeping the state in sync with the prop.

Let's go over these additional React concepts in detail:

### 13. **Do Hooks Replace Render Props and Higher-Order Components (HOCs)?**

Hooks provide a more straightforward and less nested way to reuse logic in functional components, but they donât entirely replace render props or HOCs.

- **Render Props:** Render props is a pattern in which a component takes a function as a prop, allowing you to control what is rendered. This pattern is useful for sharing logic between components.

  **Example of Render Props:**
  ```javascript
  <DataProvider render={(data) => (
      <SomeComponent data={data} />
  )} />
  ```

- **Higher-Order Components (HOCs):** HOCs are functions that take a component and return a new component with added functionality. Theyâre commonly used for cross-cutting concerns like authentication, logging, or enhancing a component with additional props.

  **Example of HOC:**
  ```javascript
  function withExtraProps(WrappedComponent) {
      return function EnhancedComponent(props) {
          return <WrappedComponent {...props} extraProp="value" />;
      };
  }
  ```

- **Hooks:** Hooks like `useState`, `useEffect`, and custom hooks allow you to use state and other React features in functional components without needing to create a class component. They reduce the need for nesting and make it easier to share logic between components without wrapping them in HOCs or using render props.

  **Why Hooks Are Simpler:**
  - **Reduced Nesting:** Hooks allow you to directly use state and other features within the component, reducing the need for nested components or functions.
  - **Readability:** Hooks often make the component tree less complex and easier to read, as they avoid the additional layers introduced by HOCs or render props.

  **However,** while Hooks provide a simpler approach for many cases, render props and HOCs are still useful in certain scenarios, especially when you need to share logic across class components or manage complex state management outside of functional components.

### 14. **Can You Force a Component to Re-Render Without Calling `setState`?**

In React, components re-render automatically when their state or props change. However, there might be situations where you want to force a re-render without directly changing state. One way to do this is by using the `forceUpdate()` method, though it's generally not recommended.

- **Using `forceUpdate()`:**
  - In class components, you can call `this.forceUpdate()` to force a re-render. This method bypasses the normal state and props checks and directly triggers a re-render.

  **Example:**
  ```javascript
  class MyComponent extends React.Component {
      handleClick = () => {
          this.forceUpdate();
      }

      render() {
          return <button onClick={this.handleClick}>Force Re-render</button>;
      }
  }
  ```

  - **Why It's Not Recommended:** `forceUpdate()` is usually considered an anti-pattern because it goes against React's design principles, which rely on changes in state or props to trigger re-renders. Forcing a re-render can lead to unexpected behavior and make your component harder to debug and maintain.

- **Better Alternatives:**
  - If you find yourself needing to force a re-render, it might be worth reviewing your componentâs logic to see if thereâs a more React-friendly way to achieve the same result, such as adjusting state or props.

### 15. **Why Canât You Update Props in React?**

In React, **props are immutable**, meaning that they cannot be changed once they are passed down from the parent to the child component. Hereâs why:

- **Unidirectional Data Flow:** React is designed around the concept of a one-way data flow. Props flow from parent components to child components, not the other way around. This makes it easier to understand and debug your application since the data always flows in one direction.

- **Immutability:** Props are meant to be a way for parents to pass data down to their children. If a child could modify its props, it would introduce unpredictability into the application, making it difficult to track the state of the app.

- **Consistency:** By keeping props immutable, React ensures that a component behaves consistently based on the props it receives. If props could be changed by the child, it would break this consistency and potentially lead to unexpected results.

- **How to Handle Mutable Data:** If a child component needs to change data that was passed in via props, the usual approach is to handle this in the parent component. The parent can pass down a function as a prop that the child can call to request a change in the data.

  **Example:**
  ```javascript
  function ParentComponent() {
      const [value, setValue] = useState(0);

      const handleUpdate = (newValue) => {
          setValue(newValue);
      }

      return <ChildComponent value={value} onUpdate={handleUpdate} />;
  }

  function ChildComponent({ value, onUpdate }) {
      return (
          <button onClick={() => onUpdate(value + 1)}>Increment</button>
      );
  }
  ```
  In this example, the child component can request a change in the parentâs state by calling the `onUpdate` function, but it cannot directly modify the `value` prop itself.
