# What is Currying Function in JavaScript?

Currying is a functional programming technique where a function with multiple arguments is transformed into a series of functions, each taking a single argument.

Instead of taking all arguments at once, the curried function takes the first argument, returns a new function that takes the next argument, and so on until all arguments are provided. The final function then returns the result.

In simpler terms, currying breaks down a function that takes multiple parameters into a chain of functions that each take one parameter.

**Note:** An American mathematician named Haskell Curry developed this technique, which is why it is called currying.

## How Currying Works

Here’s how a regular function is translated into a curried function:

```javascript
// Regular function
function simpleFunction(param1, param2, param3) {
    return param1 + param2 + param3;
}

// Curried function
function curriedFunction(param1) {
    return function(param2) {
        return function(param3) {
            return param1 + param2 + param3;
        };
    };
}
```

In a curried function:

- The outer function takes the first argument and returns a new function.
- The returned function takes the next argument and returns another function.
- This process continues until the final function is called with the last argument and produces the result.

## Why is Currying Useful in JavaScript?

Currying offers several advantages, especially when working with functional programming patterns:

- It helps us create higher-order functions.
- It reduces the chances of error in our function by dividing it into multiple smaller functions that can handle one responsibility.
- It is very useful in building modular and reusable code.
- It helps us avoid passing the same variable multiple times.
- It makes the code more readable.

## Calculating the Volume of a Cuboid

### Example 1: Regular Function

Let’s say we have the length, breadth, and height of a cuboid, and we want to construct a function that can calculate the volume. The function is called with the provided arguments and returns the appropriate result. Finally, `console.log` prints the returned value on the console.

```javascript
function calculateVolume(length, breadth, height) {
    return length * breadth * height;
}
console.log(calculateVolume(4, 5, 6));
```

**Output:**

```
120
```

### Currying with Closures

### Example 2: Curried Function

This example explains the currying technique with the help of closures. During execution, the `calculateVolume()` function will be invoked. Inside, there is an anonymous function that receives a parameter and returns some code.

We are exposing our function to another function, so a closure will be created. A closure always contains the function definition along with the lexical environment of the parent; both remain connected as a bundle. Hence, it does not matter where we invoke them; all inner functions will always hold access to the variable of their parent.

As soon as we get the returned result as a function, the next argument is ready to be passed. This process will continue until the second last function. Finally, the innermost return statement returns the expected result.

```javascript
function calculateVolume(length) {
    return function (breadth) {
        return function (height) {
            return length * breadth * height;
        }
    }
}
console.log(calculateVolume(4)(5)(6));
```

**Output:**

```
120
```

## Why is it Called Currying?

The technique is named after Haskell Curry, an American mathematician and logician, who popularized the concept. Although he didn’t invent it, currying is named in his honor due to his significant contributions to functional programming.

## Unary function in javascript
In JavaScript, a unary function is a function that takes exactly one argument. For example:

```javascript
const square = x => x * x;
const absoluteValue = x => Math.abs(x);
```

- `square(5)` returns `25`, as it squares the input.
- `absoluteValue(-5)` returns `5`, as it returns the positive value of the input.

Unary functions are commonly used in JavaScript for simple data transformations and can be applied in various programming scenarios.
