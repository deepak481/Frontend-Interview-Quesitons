### JavaScript Events
JavaScript events are signals triggered by user actions like mouse clicks, keyboard presses, or mouse movements. These events help make web pages interactive.

### Event Flow (Event Propagation)
Event flow refers to the order in which events are triggered on DOM nodes. There are two primary types of event flow:

1. **Event Bubbling**: 
   - The event starts from the innermost target element and moves up to its parent elements till it reaches outermost DOM element.
   - **Flow Direction**: Child → Parent
   - Example:
     ```html
     <div class="grandparent" onclick="console.log('grandparent')">
       <div class="parent" onclick="console.log('parent')">
         <div class="child" onclick="console.log('child')">Click Me!</div>
       </div>
     </div>
     ```
   - Clicking the `child` div logs "child", followed by "parent", and then "grandparent".

2. **Event Capturing**:
   - The event starts from the outermost element, and then successively triggers on the children of the target element and continues till it reaches the innermost DOM element.
   - **Flow Direction**: Parent → Child
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     grandparent.addEventListener("click", e => console.log("grandparent"), true);
     parent.addEventListener("click", e => console.log("parent"), true);
     child.addEventListener("click", e => console.log("child"), true);
     ```
   - Clicking the `child` div first logs "grandparent", followed by "parent", and then "child".

### Controlling Event Propagation
You can control event propagation using the `event.stopPropagation()` method, which prevents the event from propagating to other DOM elements:

- **Stopping Propagation**: 
  - Example:
    ```javascript
    child.addEventListener("click", e => {
      e.stopPropagation();
      console.log("child");
    });
    ```
  - In this case, only "child" is logged, and the event does not propagate to the parent elements.

### Key Points
- **Event Bubbling** is the default behavior.
- **Event Capturing** must be explicitly enabled by setting `{capture: true}` or `true` as the third argument in `addEventListener`.
- **event.stopPropagation()** can be used to halt the propagation of an event, affecting both bubbling and capturing.

This understanding is crucial for managing complex interactions on web pages and ensuring the desired behavior of events.
