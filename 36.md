## React 18 Upgrade Guide and New Features

### Introduction
Transitioning between different versions of libraries can be challenging due to changes in features. Upgrading to the most recent version ensures better performance and access to the latest features. This guide covers the upgrade process from React 17 to React 18, highlighting the issues with React 17, new features in React 18, and the benefits of upgrading.

### What is React 18?
React 18, any stable version from 18.0.0 upwards but not including 19.0.0, introduces concurrent rendering in React applications. This allows React to adapt the rendering process to client devices, improving performance and user experience.

### Upgrading to React 18

**Using CDN:**
```html
<!-- Load React. -->
<script src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.development.js" crossorigin></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.development.js" crossorigin></script>
<script src="app.js"></script>
```

**Using NPM:**
```sh
npm install react react-dom
```

**Using Yarn:**
```sh
yarn add react react-dom
```

These commands will detect and install or upgrade to the most recent versions of React and React DOM.

### Issues with React 17

**1. Render Errors:** Returning `undefined` from a component breaks the application.
**2. State Update Warnings:** Updating state in unmounted components may cause memory leak warnings.
**3. Strict Mode Log Suppression:** Suppressing console logs in Strict Mode creates confusion.
**4. Memory Consumption:** Issues with memory leaks, especially in unmounted components.

### What Changed in React 18

**1. Client Rendering:**
- React 17:
  ```jsx
  import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
  import App from "App";

  const app = document.getElementById("app");
  ReactDOM.render(<App />, app);
  ```

- React 18:
  ```jsx
  import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";
  import App from "App";

  const app = document.getElementById("app");
  const root = createRoot(app);
  root.render(<App />);
  ```

**2. Hydration:**
- React 17:
  ```jsx
  import * as ReactDOM from "react-dom";
  import App from "App";

  const app = document.getElementById("app");
  ReactDOM.hydrate(<App tab="home" />, app);
  ```

- React 18:
  ```jsx
  import { hydrateRoot } from "react-dom/client";
  import App from "App";

  const app = document.getElementById("app");
  const root = hydrateRoot(app, <App tab="home" />);
  ```

**3. Render Callback:**
- React 17:
  ```jsx
  import * as ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
  import App from 'App';

  const app = document.getElementById('app');
  ReactDOM.render(app, <App tab="home" />, function() {
    console.log('Rendered or Updated');
  });
  ```

- React 18:
  ```jsx
  import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";

  function App({ callback }) {
    return (
      <div ref={callback}>
        <h1>Hello World</h1>
      </div>
    );
  }

  const app = document.getElementById("root");
  const root = createRoot(app);
  root.render(<App callback={() => console.log("Rendered or Updated")} />);
  ```

**4. Automatic Batching:**
- React 17: Only batches state updates in event handlers.
  ```jsx
  const handleClick = () => {
    setFirstState("1");
    setSecondState("2");
  };
  ```

- React 18: Batches state updates everywhere.
  ```jsx
  fetch('https://api.com').then(() => {
    setFirstState("1");
    setSecondState("2");
  });

  setTimeout(() => {
    setFirstState("1");
    setSecondState("2");
  });
  ```

  To disable automatic batching:
  ```jsx
  import { flushSync } from "react-dom";

  function handleClick() {
    flushSync(() => {
      setFirstState("1");
    });

    flushSync(() => {
      setSecondState("2");
    });
  }
  ```

**5. Transitions:**
  ```jsx
  import { startTransition } from "react";

  setSearchCurrentValue(input);

  startTransition(() => {
    setSearchFinalValue(input);
  });
  ```

**6. Dropped Support for Internet Explorer:**
React 18 no longer supports Internet Explorer, focusing on modern browser features.

### Benefits of React 18 over React 17

**1. Concurrency:** Optimizes performance by allowing React apps to better manage rendering processes.
**2. Memory Management:** Enhances memory management by clearing out background tasks on unmount, reducing memory leaks.

### Conclusion
Upgrading to React 18 provides significant improvements and new features that enhance performance and developer experience. Keep an eye on the React library changelogs for updates and stay in touch with the React community for the latest information.

### Notes
- **Client Rendering:** Use `createRoot` instead of `ReactDOM.render`.
- **Hydration:** Use `hydrateRoot` instead of `ReactDOM.hydrate`.
- **Render Callback:** Use ref callback, `setTimeout`, or `requestIdleCallback`.
- **Automatic Batching:** Enabled by default, use `flushSync` to disable.
- **Transitions:** Use `startTransition` for non-urgent updates.
- **Browser Support:** No support for Internet Explorer in React 18.
