Here are comprehensive notes for common interview questions related to CSS media queries:

### 1. What is a media query in CSS?

- **Definition:** A media query is a CSS technique used to apply different styles depending on certain characteristics of the device or viewport, such as screen size, device orientation, or resolution.

### 2. How do you write a basic media query?

- **Syntax:** A basic media query starts with the `@media` rule followed by a media type (like `screen` or `print`) and one or more media features enclosed in parentheses. For example:
  ```css
  @media screen and (max-width: 600px) {
    /* CSS rules for screens smaller than 600px */
  }
  ```

### 3. What are media features in CSS media queries?

- **Explanation:** Media features are characteristics of the user's device or environment that can be targeted with media queries. Examples include width, height, orientation, and resolution.

### 4. How do you target different screen sizes with media queries?

- **Usage:** Different screen sizes are targeted using media features like `min-width`, `max-width`, `min-height`, and `max-height`. Example:
  ```css
  @media screen and (max-width: 768px) {
    /* Styles for screens up to 768px wide */
  }
  ```

### 5. Explain the difference between `min-width` and `max-width` in media queries.

- **Difference:** 
  - `min-width`: Applies styles when the viewport width is equal to or greater than the specified value.
  - `max-width`: Applies styles when the viewport width is equal to or less than the specified value.

### 6. How do you handle high-resolution displays using media queries?

- **Approach:** High-resolution displays, like Retina displays, can be targeted using `min-resolution` and `max-resolution` media features. Example:
  ```css
  @media screen and (min-resolution: 300dpi) {
    /* Styles for high-resolution screens */
  }
  ```

### 7. Can you use multiple conditions in a single media query?

- **Capability:** Yes, multiple conditions can be combined using logical operators like `and`, `or`, and `not`. Example:
  ```css
  @media screen and (max-width: 768px) and (orientation: landscape) {
    /* Styles for screens up to 768px wide in landscape orientation */
  }
  ```

### 8. How do you include media queries in your CSS file?

- **Integration:** Media queries can be directly included in your CSS file using the `@media` rule. Alternatively, they can be placed in a separate CSS file and linked to your HTML document using the `<link>` tag.
