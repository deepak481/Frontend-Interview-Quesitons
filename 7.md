### Unidirectional Data Flow in React

- **Description:** Data flows in one direction, from parent to child components.
- **Mechanism:** Ensures a predictable data flow, making the application easier to debug and understand.

### Difference Between State and Props

- **Props:**
  - **Purpose:** Used to pass data from a parent component to a child component.
  - **Mutability:** Immutable and cannot be changed within a component.
  - **Scope:** Passed down from the parent component and are read-only within the child component.
  - **Use Case:** Customize the behavior or appearance of a component by passing data from the parent.

- **State:**
  - **Purpose:** Used to manage data within a component.
  - **Mutability:** Mutable and can be updated using the `setState` function.
  - **Scope:** Only accessible within the component where it is defined.
  - **Use Case:** Keep track of information that can change over time within the component.

### Summary

- **Unidirectional Data Flow:**
  - Data flows from parent to child components, ensuring a predictable and easy-to-debug application structure.

  - **Props:**
    - Pass data from parent to child.
    - Immutable and read-only within the child component.
    - Customizes behavior or appearance.
  - **State:**
