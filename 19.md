function wrapperFunction(func) {
return function(args) {
   func(args);
}
}
func have lexical scope
is upper function is correct example of closure

The example provided in your question demonstrates a function `wrapperFunction` that takes a function `func` as an argument and returns a new function. This new function, when called, invokes the original `func` with the given arguments. Here's the code you provided:

```javascript
function wrapperFunction(func) {
    return function(args) {
        func(args);
    }
}
```

This is an example of a higher-order function because `wrapperFunction` takes a function as an argument and returns a function. However, it doesn't fully illustrate the concept of a closure.

To understand closures better, let's break down the concept:

### What is a Closure?

A closure in JavaScript is a function that retains access to its lexical scope, even when the function is executed outside that lexical scope. In other words, a closure allows a function to remember and access variables from its containing (or outer) function even after that outer function has finished executing.

### Example of a Closure

Here's a classic example of a closure:

```javascript
function outerFunction() {
    let outerVariable = 'I am from the outer scope';

    function innerFunction() {
        console.log(outerVariable); // Accessing the outer scope variable
    }

    return innerFunction;
}

const closureFunction = outerFunction();
closureFunction(); // Outputs: I am from the outer scope
```

In this example:
1. `outerFunction` defines a variable `outerVariable` and a nested `innerFunction`.
2. `innerFunction` has access to `outerVariable` because of the lexical scoping.
3. When `outerFunction` is called, it returns `innerFunction`.
4. Even though `outerFunction` has finished executing, the returned `innerFunction` retains access to `outerVariable`â€”this retained access is what we call a closure.

### Your Example and Closures

Now, let's revisit your example:

```javascript
function wrapperFunction(func) {
    return function(args) {
        func(args);
    }
}
```

In this case:
- `wrapperFunction` takes a function `func` as an argument and returns a new function.
- The returned function, when called, invokes `func` with the provided arguments.

This demonstrates a higher-order function but doesn't illustrate a closure by itself because the inner function does not capture any variables from the `wrapperFunction`'s scope.

### Modifying Your Example to Illustrate a Closure

To make your example illustrate a closure, you could modify it like this:

```javascript
function wrapperFunction(func) {
    let wrapperVariable = 'I am a closure variable';

    return function(args) {
        console.log(wrapperVariable); // Accessing the outer scope variable
        func(args);
    }
}

function sayHello(name) {
    console.log('Hello, ' + name);
}

const wrappedSayHello = wrapperFunction(sayHello);
wrappedSayHello('Alice'); // Outputs: I am a closure variable
                          //          Hello, Alice
```

In this modified example:
- `wrapperFunction` has a variable `wrapperVariable`.
- The returned function (a closure) retains access to `wrapperVariable` even after `wrapperFunction` has finished executing.
- When you call `wrappedSayHello`, it first logs the `wrapperVariable` value and then calls the original `sayHello` function.

This demonstrates how closures work in JavaScript.
